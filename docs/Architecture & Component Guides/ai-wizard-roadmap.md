# AI-Guided Project Authoring & Scaffolding: Vision & Roadmap

This document outlines the next evolution of Stack Composer: a fully AI-guided, end-to-end project discovery, planning, and scaffolding platform. It synthesizes gap analyses, best practices, and actionable recommendations for a system that guides users from idea to ready-to-implement codebase.

---

## 1. Conversational AI Wizard: Step-by-Step Discovery

- Multi-step, hybrid conversational-form wizard (3–5 stages: intent, tech, deployment, etc.)
- Persistent session context for backtracking and dynamic follow-ups
- Proactive, human-like prompts and suggestions
- “Why?” tooltips and rationale for every major choice

## 2. Interactive Planning & Tech Stack Exploration

- After initial stack proposal, allow “what-if” exploration and trade-off comparisons
- UI for alternatives with cost, maintenance, and time insights
- Integrate non-functional requirements (security, scalability, compliance) into planning logic

## 3. Directory Tree Preview & Scaffold Customisation

- Interactive, real-time preview of the generated directory tree (tree and graph views)
- Stub files with embedded comments/TODOs explaining purpose
- UI toggles to include/exclude features, updating preview dynamically

## 4. Enhanced UI & Copilot Functionality

- Chat-based copilot pane for Q&A, code snippets, and explanations
- Undo/redo, decision history, and summary confirmation before finalization
- “Export to DevContainer” and “Open in Code Editor” integrations

## 5. Context-Aware Intelligence & External Knowledge

- Integrate GitHub trending, CVE feeds, and StackOverflow for up-to-date recommendations and risk warnings
- Learn from user/project history to personalize future suggestions
- Push updated best practices and highlight risky dependencies

## 6. End-to-End Automation & Deployability

- One-click project generation: initializes repo, scaffold, CI/CD, DevContainer
- Export to GitHub, Jira, Codespaces, and cloud IDEs
- Hooks for cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, etc.)

## 7. Templates, Import & Project History

- Template projects (web app, microservice, CLI, etc.)
- Project history, versioned scaffolds, and decision revisitability
- Import existing repos for analysis, modernization, and refactoring suggestions

## 8. Security & Dependency Risk Awareness

- Surface dependency risk info (CVE lookup) during stack selection
- Highlight vulnerable versions and suggest patches
- Inline rationale for security decisions

## Open Questions for Further Design

1. Wizard format: Fully chat-based, form-style, or hybrid UI?
2. Customization breadth: How deeply can users tailor CI, infra, test frameworks?
3. Explainability: Should every decision include rationale and trade-offs?
4. Key integrations: Which tools/platforms to prioritize (GitHub, Jira, cloud providers)?
5. Importing projects: Is legacy code refactoring a core use case?
6. Tree visualization: Tree list, collapsible graph, or hybrid?

## Phased Implementation Roadmap

| Feature                | MVP (Phase 1)             | Phase 2 Enhancements         | Phase 3 Extensions               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| UI Mode                | Hybrid chat/forms         | Undo/redo, graph/tree toggle | Full copilot/chat + history      |
| Rationale              | “Why?” tooltips           | Trade-offs, inline explain   | External data (trends, CVEs)     |
| Scaffold Visualization | Tree view form-style      | Graph view, live stubs       | Interactive scaffold editing     |
| Overrides & Prompts    | “Are you sure?” for risky | Override recommendations     | Suggest improvements on override |
| Export & Integration   | GitHub repo scaffold      | DevContainer, CI toggles     | Jira, cloud IDE, template export |
| Project Import         | Inform users              | Wizard for import flow       | Scaffold modernization engine    |
