## Developer Environment

For a reproducible, fast, and modern developer experience, use the pre-configured Dev Container or Nix environment. See [Toolchain & DX Pipeline](../toolchain.md) for the full toolchain and workflow details.

- Run `just bootstrap` to set up all dependencies and services
- Use `just check` and `just test` for linting and tests
- See [Developer Setup](dev-setup.md) for step-by-step onboarding
