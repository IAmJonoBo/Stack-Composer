# Documentation Structure

Welcome to the Stack Composer documentation!

## Structure

- All curated documentation lives in `docs/src/` and is built with mdBook.
- Each major section (Getting Started, Architecture, Components, User Guides, Operations, Release Engineering, Contributing) has its own folder and README.
- All navigation is managed via `docs/src/SUMMARY.md`.

## Contributing

- To add or update docs, edit or add files in `docs/src/`.
- Keep folder and file names in kebab-case.
- Use relative links and update `SUMMARY.md` for navigation.
- Run `mdbook build` to preview changes locally.

## Legacy

- All legacy and redundant folders/files have been removed for clarity and maintainability.

For more, see the [Contributing Guide](src/contributing/README.md).
