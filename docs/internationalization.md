# Internationalization (i18n) Strategy

Stack Composer aims to support a global user base. Our internationalization strategy includes:

- Modular UI components with language/locale support
- Translatable wizard prompts, rationale, and error messages
- Locale-aware formatting for dates, numbers, and code comments
- Community-driven translation contributions

If you are interested in contributing to localization or have specific language needs, please open a GitHub Issue or Discussion.
