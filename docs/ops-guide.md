# Operations Guide

For reproducible local operations, see [Toolchain & DX Pipeline](toolchain.md) and [Developer Setup](Developer & Extensibility Docs/dev-setup.md) for Docker, Nix, and all required tools.

- Qdrant runs via Docker for local development.
- Use `trivy` for container and SBOM health/security checks.
- Nix enables reproducible ops environments.

Add ontology crawl and health checks here.
