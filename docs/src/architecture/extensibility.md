# Extensibility

This module summarizes extensibility points in Stack Composer.

- **WASI capability tokens:** Restrict plugins to declarative host functions.
- **Model abstraction trait:** Swap LLM backends (Ollama, vLLM, LM-Studio, etc.) without changing agent logic.
- **GraphRAG plug-in:** (Planned) Property-graph retrieval for richer answers.

See [architecture-overview.md](architecture-overview.md#extensibility-points) and [Plugin SDK](../plugin-sdk/README.md) for more.
