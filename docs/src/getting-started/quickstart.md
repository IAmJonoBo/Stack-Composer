# Quickstart

Welcome to Stack Composer! This quickstart will help you get up and running quickly.

1. Review [dev-setup.md](../developer-extensibility-docs/dev-setup.md) for environment setup.
2. Install all required tools as described in [toolchain.md](../toolchain.md).
3. Follow the workflow in the [README](../../README.md) to start developing or contributing.

> **Note:** For details on using local Python/conda environments versus the devcontainer, see [dev-setup.md](../developer-extensibility-docs/dev-setup.md#python--conda-workflows#python--conda-workflows).

For troubleshooting, see the relevant sections in [dev-setup.md](../developer-extensibility-docs/dev-setup.md#troubleshooting#troubleshooting) and [toolchain.md](../toolchain.md#troubleshooting).
