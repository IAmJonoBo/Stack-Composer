# Internationalization

Stack Composer ships with English (en-US) copy by default while we lay the groundwork for
localized experiences. This document explains the projectâ€™s i18n posture, outlines how new
strings should be authored, and captures the plan for future language support.

## Current Scope

- **UI copy**: All strings live in TypeScript modules under `stack-ui/src/locales/en`. The
  wizard and settings views load text through a simple key-based helper to avoid hard-coded
  strings in components.
- **Rust agents**: User-facing log messages and errors are emitted in English. Translating
  these messages will rely on `fluent`-style bundles once the orchestration layer stabilizes.
- **Documentation**: Markdown content is written in English. Machine-translated mirrors are
  intentionally avoided to keep tone and technical accuracy high.

## Authoring Guidelines

1. **Use message keys**
   - Add new UI strings to `stack-ui/src/locales/en/app.json` (or the relevant namespace).
   - Prefer sentence casing and avoid embedded markup when possible.
2. **Provide context**
   - Include developer comments explaining variable placeholders or tone (e.g., `{count}`).
   - Reference related components or flows so translators understand the usage.
3. **Keep copy concise**
   - Favor short, declarative sentences that translate well.
   - Avoid culturally specific idioms or humor unless the feature demands it.
4. **Parameterize units and dates**
   - Use utility functions for formatting numbers, currencies, and dates to avoid locale bugs.

## Testing

- A pseudo-localization toggle (`PSEUDO_LOCALE=1`) stretches strings and injects accent
  marks to expose layout regressions.
- Playwright smoke tests run with the pseudo locale at least once per release.
- Visual regression snapshots include pseudo-localized variants of key screens.

## Roadmap

| Milestone             | Goal                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sprint S-02           | Finalize message catalog shape and pseudo-localization tooling.           |
| Sprint S-03           | Introduce locale selection in the onboarding wizard.                      |
| Sprint S-04           | Add translation bundles for documentation landing pages (ES + PT).        |
| Post S-06             | Expand to community-driven translations with Crowdin or Weblate adapters. |

These targets align with the broader roadmap in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` and will evolve as the
community prioritizes additional languages.

## Contributing Translations

1. Fork the repo and add a locale file under `stack-ui/src/locales/<lang>/app.json`.
2. Populate the file with the same keys as the English catalog; keep placeholders identical.
3. Update the locale manifest (`stack-ui/src/locales/index.ts`) to register the new language.
4. Add a Storybook story demonstrating the UI in the new locale.
5. Submit a PR using the `type:docs` label and mention native speakers available for review.

Until the managed translation platform is in place, we merge new locales on a case-by-case
basis, prioritizing maintainability and reviewer availability.
