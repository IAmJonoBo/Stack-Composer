# Telemetry & Privacy

Stack Composer is designed with privacy in mind.

- See [dev-setup.md](../Developer%20&%20Extensibility%20Docs/dev-setup.md) for details on telemetry configuration.

- The toolchain ([toolchain.md](toolchain.md)) includes instructions for managing telemetry and privacy settings.

- Local JSON flow and GDPR toggles are documented in the relevant sections.

## Troubleshooting

- For telemetry or privacy issues, see [dev-setup.md](../Developer%20&%20Extensibility%20Docs/dev-setup.md#troubleshooting).
